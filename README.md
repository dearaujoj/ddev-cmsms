A [DDEV](https://ddev.com) add-on that turns a CMS Made Simple extension repository (module, plugin, or theme) into a full, disposable CMSMS dev site. It downloads the official CMSMS installer, drives it headlessly (no browser wizard), symlinks your extension into a running core, and installs it — all from `ddev start`. The core lives in a gitignored `.cmsms/` directory next to your extension source, so the repo you're developing stays clean.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd my-module/
mkdir -p .cmsms/public
ddev config --project-type=php --docroot=.cmsms/public
ddev add-on get <owner>/ddev-cmsms
ddev cmsms setup
ddev start
ddev launch        # frontend; `ddev cmsms admin` opens /admin (admin/admin)
```

Admin credentials default to `admin` / `admin`. Override them with the `CMSMS_ADMIN_USER` / `CMSMS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables before the first install (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ddev cmsms setup [--type module\|plugin\|theme] [--name NAME] [--version X.Y.Z] [--yes]` | Detects (or accepts) the extension type/name and CMSMS version, validates them, and writes `.ddev/config.cmsms-project.yaml`. Without `--yes`, prompts interactively for anything not passed as a flag, offering the auto-detected value as the default. `--yes` runs fully non-interactively, falling back to auto-detected values for anything not passed. |
| `ddev cmsms admin` | Prints the admin credentials (`admin`/`admin` by default) and opens `/admin` in your browser. |
| `ddev cmsms status` | Reports the installed CMSMS core version vs. the configured one, the extension type/name, whether it's symlinked, and whether it's registered in the database. |
| `ddev cmsms reinstall [--yes]` | Drops the database and clears the core/installer files (keeping the download cache and `uploads/`), then re-runs the full install. Prompts for confirmation unless `--yes`/`-y` is passed — this is destructive. |
| `ddev cmsms package` | Module projects only. Builds the distributable module XML via the module's own `CreateXMLPackage()`, written to `dist/<Name>-<version>.xml`. |

Setup validates `--name` against `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$` and `--version` against a dotted-numeric pattern; invalid values are rejected with an error before anything is written.

The install pipeline itself (fetch → files → db → link) runs automatically via a `post-start` hook (`ddev cmsms-install all`), and each stage is idempotent — safe to re-run individually with `ddev cmsms-install <stage>` for debugging.

## Configuration

Extension identity and target CMSMS version live in `.ddev/config.cmsms-project.yaml`, written by `ddev cmsms setup` (edit it by hand and `ddev restart` if you prefer):

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CMSMS_EXT_TYPE` | `module`, `plugin`, or `theme`. |
| `CMSMS_EXT_NAME` | Extension name (module class name, theme name — not used for plugins). |
| `CMSMS_VERSION` | CMSMS core version to install; must be a key in `cmsms/versions.json`. |

Other environment variables, settable via `.ddev/config.cmsms-project.yaml`'s `web_environment` block or any other DDEV env mechanism:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CMSMS_INSTALLER_URL` | Overrides the resolved download URL — point it at a direct `cmsms-X.Y.Z-install.zip` URL (mirror or local file server) if the default Forge URL is unreachable. |
| `CMSMS_SAMPLE_CONTENT` | Set to `1` to install CMSMS's demo/sample content instead of the minimal default page. |
| `CMSMS_ADMIN_USER` / `CMSMS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Override the admin account created during install (default `admin`/`admin`). |
| `CMSMS_LINK_EXCLUDE` | Space-separated list of top-level repo entries to skip when symlinking (default: `.ddev .cmsms .git .gitignore dist docs`). |
| `CMSMS_INSTALL_VERBOSE` | Set to `1` for verbose per-module logging during the headless DB install. |

## Testing against another core / PHP version

```bash
# another CMSMS core
edit .ddev/config.cmsms-project.yaml   # change CMSMS_VERSION
ddev restart && ddev cmsms reinstall --yes

# another PHP
ddev config --php-version=8.1 && ddev restart
```

Supported core versions are the keys of [`cmsms/versions.json`](cmsms/versions.json), regenerated with `scripts/update-versions.sh` (scrapes the CMSMS Forge file listing). CI verifies 2.2.22 (PHP 8.3 and 8.1), 2.2.21, and 2.2.19 on every push and weekly on a schedule (to catch download-URL rot); other listed versions are expected to work but aren't continuously tested — see [`.github/workflows/tests.yml`](.github/workflows/tests.yml).

## Xdebug

```bash
ddev xdebug on
```

Set a single IDE path mapping from your repository root to `/var/www/html` — the CMSMS core (`.cmsms/public`) lives inside the repo, so this one mapping covers breakpoints in both your extension code and core files.

## Mail

[Mailpit](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/troubleshooting/#mailpit) is preconfigured — the installed site's mail preferences point at `localhost:1025` (SMTP) out of the box. View captured mail with:

```bash
ddev launch -m
```

## How it works

CMSMS's official installer is a self-extracting phar that runs a browser wizard and explicitly refuses to run non-interactively from the CLI. `ddev-cmsms` sidesteps the wizard entirely: it extracts the phar's bundled core and installer app, then includes the installer's own `app/install/*.php` scripts (schema, base data, admin account, content, system modules) directly inside a small PHP driver that reconstructs the scope and globals they expect — the same steps the wizard's `wizard_step8`/`wizard_step9` perform, without a browser in the loop.

Your extension isn't copied into the core; instead, each top-level file/directory in your repo gets an individual symlink into the right core location (`modules/<Name>/`, `plugins/`, or `admin/themes/<Name>/`), skipping a configurable exclusion list (`.ddev`, `.cmsms`, `.git`, etc.). Per-entry linking — rather than symlinking the whole repo root in one shot — is what avoids a symlink cycle (the core lives inside `.cmsms/`, which lives inside the repo being linked).

The `.cmsms/` directory (downloaded core, installer scratch space, generated `config.php`) is disposable and gitignored automatically by the add-on's post-install hook, so it never pollutes your extension's repository.

## Troubleshooting

- **Installer download fails**: set `CMSMS_INSTALLER_URL` to a working direct `cmsms-X.Y.Z-install.zip` URL (mirror or local file) and re-run.
- **Install partially completed / left in a bad state**: `ddev cmsms-install all` is safe to re-run — every stage (fetch, files, db, link) checks its own completion marker and skips work already done.
- **Not sure what's installed or linked**: `ddev cmsms status` reports the core version, configured extension, symlink state, and DB registration in one shot.
- **Need a database GUI**: this add-on depends on [`ddev/ddev-phpmyadmin`](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-phpmyadmin) — run `ddev phpmyadmin` to open it.
